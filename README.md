# ToolRackSetup

Super beta.

0. Copy your entire CNCM directory in case something gets messed up, so you can go back to the prior version.
1. You have to have done the avid touch plate setup routine and set the spoilboard location.
2. Definitely do a test with Test Mode enabled first! 
3. Do the first tests without any tools in the machine or tool rack!
4. Before you set your z-heights for any pocket, set them "high", like -3", and do tests all really "high" in the air to make sure things are working the way you expected in the x/y position and that movements are happening in the directions you expect, and that you hear the clamp/unclamp at correct times.
