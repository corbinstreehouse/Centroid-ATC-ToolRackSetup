Goals:
* Full ATC support for rack style tool pockets
* Easy UI to setup the tool pocket position
* Any tool number in any pocket number
* Automatic tool height measurement
* Support tools not in the rack: user prompts to install and remove when needed
* Tool Library Management
* Save & restore the position when a tool change happens; this is necessary for Vectricâ€™s post to work well.
