# Centroid ATC Support for Avid CNC Machines

These are macros and a tool library mangement program for Centroid CNC12, designed to work with Avid CNC's EX Controller.

Currently in beta.

Directions: https://www.corbinstreehouse.com/blog/atc-automatic-tool-changer-for-centroid-cnc12/

Goals:
* Full ATC support for rack style tool pockets
* Easy UI to setup the tool pocket position
* Any tool number in any pocket number
* Automatic tool height measurement
* Support tools not in the rack: user prompts to install and remove when needed
* Tool Library Management
* Save & restore the position when a tool change happens; this is necessary for Vectricâ€™s post to work well.
